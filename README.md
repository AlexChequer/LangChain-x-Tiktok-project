# Introduction
This repository is part of my journey to better understand LangChain and its potential applications. The goal is to integrate LangChain with other tools, like Streamlit and MoviePy, to create an app capable of analyzing YouTube video transcripts and generating short, engaging clips optimized for TikTok.

# Features
YouTube Transcript Loader: Extracts transcripts from YouTube videos using LangChain's YouTube loader.
LLM Analysis: Uses an AI model to identify engaging segments.
Video Clipping: Automatically clips and edits video segments for TikTok using MoviePy.
Streamlit Interface: Simple UI for users to input YouTube links and download clips.

# How It Works
Input: User provides a YouTube video link through the Streamlit app.
Transcript Extraction: LangChain's YouTube loader fetches the transcript and metadata.
Segment Analysis: An LLM analyzes the transcript to find engaging or viral-worthy moments.
Video Clipping: MoviePy cuts the video at the identified timestamps.
Output: User downloads the generated TikTok-ready clips.

# Tech Stack
Streamlit: For the user interface.
LangChain: To handle transcript loading and processing.
OpenAI API: For analyzing transcripts and identifying key segments.
pytube: For downloading YouTube videos.
MoviePy: For editing video clips.
Python: The core programming language.
